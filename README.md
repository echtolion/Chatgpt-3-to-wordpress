# Chatgpt-3-to-wordpress
python script written by chatgpt with tutroail written by chatgpt to use openai to create content then save it and can then be uploaded to your wordpress.


This code is a Python script that uses the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a text generation program. It also uses the OpenAI API and the python-wordpress-xmlrpc library to interact with a WordPress site. The script does the following:

It imports the necessary libraries (Tkinter, filedialog, os, messagebox, openai, Client, WordPressPost, GetPosts, NewPost).
It defines several functions that are called when the user interacts with the GUI.
a. The generate_text function gets a prompt from the user, calls the OpenAI API to generate text based on the prompt, and displays the generated text in the output text field.
b. The save_text function allows the user to save the generated text to a file.
c. The post_to_wordpress function uses the python-wordpress-xmlrpc library to create a new post on a WordPress site with the generated text as the content.
d. The paraphrase_text function loads text from a file, paraphrase it and then display it on the output text field.
It creates a new Tkinter window and sets its title.
It creates a label and text field for the input prompt.
It creates a button to generate text.
It creates a text field for the output.
It creates a button to save the text.
It creates a button to post the text to a WordPress site.
It creates a button to paraphrase text.
It creates a button to quit the program.
To use this code, you will need to have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them by running the following commands in the terminal:

Copy code
pip install tk
pip install openai
pip install python-wordpress-xmlrpc
Additionally, you will also need to replace the placeholder text "input API key here" with your own API key from OpenAI.
and you will also need to replace the placeholder text of the WordPress site, username and password with your own

You can run the script by using the command python scriptname.py

Note that the openai.Completion.create() function is using the "text-davinci-003" model, which is the most capable of all GPT-3 models and so quite expensive. If you want to use this code, you will probably want to adjust the code to use one of the less expensive models, such as "text-curie-001" or "text-babbage-001".

The paraphrase_text() function is not tested but it could work as it's using the same method of generating text as the generate_text() function but with different prompt "paraphrase following text:".
